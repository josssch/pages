    <p>
        Welcome to my website! I'm a software developer based in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Ontario,
        I've been writing code since the age of <b>11</b>
        <sub>({new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years)</sub> and haven't stopped
        since.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently attending college for
        <b>Computer Programming & Analysis</b> and working as a tutor &
        freelancer in the meantime. If you're interested in this please
        <a href="mailto:{EMAIL}">write me an email</a> or open a ticket in my Discord.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before returning to freelancing, I was hired out of my high school co-op
        program to work full-time as a software developer in a department of
        two. Internally, I was developing a suite of tools to tie multiple
        systems together into one easy place, and automating jobs that would
        otherwise take hours.
